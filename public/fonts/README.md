# Font Instructions

To complete the UI implementation with the Primera Trial font:

1. Download the Primera Trial font (specifically the Medium weight)
2. Place the font file in this directory as `PrimeraTrial-Medium.woff2`
3. If the font is available in a different format, update the `@font-face` declaration in `src/app/globals.css` accordingly

Note: If you're unable to obtain the Primera Trial font, you can substitute it with a similar font and update the font-family configuration in `tailwind.config.ts` and the `@font-face` declaration in `globals.css`.
